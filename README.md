## ASCII-decimal-to-ASCII-char

By <strong>Seven#2672</strong> on Discord!

Converts <strong>decimal ASCII code</strong> to <strong>char ASCII code</strong> (extended ASCII not supported).

# How to use

Dump the decimal ASCII code in a <strong>dump.txt</strong> file in the same directory as the script.

The decimal ASCII code <em>must</em> be separated by a <strong>newline<strong>.

<ul><li><code>./encrypt_ASCII.sh # (As long as you didn't mess up in dump.txt it should work fine)</code></li></ul>

A bit more information in the comments present in the script.
